      In Sequelize, the pool object refers to connection pooling,

      If Sequelize pool is configured with max: 5, and 10 routes are simultaneously querying the database, then:
      5 queries will immediately get a connection from the pool and start executing.
      The other 5 queries will have to wait in a queue until a connection is released (i.e., one of the active queries finishes and returns its connection to the pool).
      This queuing continues until:
      A connection becomes available (within the time specified by acquire), or
      The request times out (if it waits longer than acquire ms), in which case Sequelize will throw a connection timeout error.
